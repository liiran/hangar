## hangar bench: sim agent, preset `popular`, every session opens a page in its browser, npx fast path off

Servers: playwright, context7, memory, sequential-thinking, filesystem. Machine: 31.06 GB RAM, 12 logical CPUs, windows.

| Sessions | Mode | MCP processes | MCP memory (private) | Agent memory | CPU to start | Ready p50 | Ready p95 | Ready max | Failed | Leftovers after close |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | pooled | 73 | 1.86 GB | - | 16.5 s | 3.4 s | 3.5 s | 3.5 s | 0 | 0 (0 MB) |

Each configuration ran once, direct before pooled. Memory is private (committed) bytes summed over every process, so shared DLL pages are not double counted. CPU comes from job-object accounting and includes processes that exited during startup. Ready is the slowest server of each session; p95 uses the nearest-rank method. Leftovers are processes still alive 5 s after every session closed, excluding servers the pool keeps warm on purpose.
